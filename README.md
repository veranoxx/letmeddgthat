For people who cannot DuckDuckGo something themselves.
"Let Me DDG That" is a web project inspired by "Let Me Google That." It provides a funny and snarky way to create and share DuckDuckGo search queries with others.

## How It Works
1. Enter a search query.
2. Generate a link that redirects to DuckDuckGo with the query pre-filled.
3. Share the link with anyone to let them "Duck it!"
